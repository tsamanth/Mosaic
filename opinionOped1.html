        <p>
            <br/><br/>The year 2020 may have been heartbreaking for most humans, but it was a good one for Jeff Bezos and Amazon. His company’s worldwide sales grew 38 percent from 2019, and Amazon sold more than 1.5 billion products during the 2020 holiday season alone.
            <br/><br/>Did you need a book, disposable surgical mask, beauty product, or garden hose? Amazon was probably your online marketplace. If you wanted to purchase a Nicolas Cage pillowcase or a harness with leash for your chicken, Amazon had your back (They’re No. 17 and No. 39 on a 2019 Good Housekeeping list of the 40 “weirdest” products available on the website “that people actually love.”) From pandemic misery came consumer comfort and corporate profit.
            <br/><br/>And plastic. Lots and lots of plastic.
            <br/><br/>In 2019, Amazon used an estimated 465 million pounds of plastic packaging, according to the nonprofit environmental group Oceana. The group also estimated that up to 22 million pounds of Amazon’s plastic packaging waste ended up as trash in freshwater and marine ecosystems around the world. These numbers are likely to rise in 2021.
