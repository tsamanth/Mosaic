        <p>
            <br/><br/>First there was the agonizing video, showing Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin grinding his knee into George Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes as three of his colleagues watched and didn't intervene. Then came the protests, a national wave of outrage coursing through communities large and small.
            <br/><br/>Now the nation is watching Chauvin's trial, underway in a Minnesota courtroom -- nearly 10 months after Floyd's death. It's a chance for the wheels of justice to finally turn. And it's a moment to ask ourselves:
            <br/><br/>If another officer were to engage in similar misconduct today, would his colleagues again refuse to step in and stop it?
            <br/><br/>We serve together on the Council on Criminal Justice Task Force on Policing -- a Georgia police chief and a parent who founded Mothers Against Police Brutality after her son was killed by police in 2013. Not surprisingly, we don't see eye-to-eye on everything. But like our nine task force colleagues, we do agree on what's needed to ensure officers don't stand idly by as tragedies like Floyd's death unfold.
