		</div>
		<p>Less than three months after the Jan. 6 riot, a Capitol Police officer was killed when a man slammed his car into him and another officer.The suspect, a 25-year-old man who was alone and armed with a knife, was shot and killed.</p>
		<p>The attack shocked a Capitol slowly returning to normalcy, raising new questions about securing the complex.</p>

                </div>
		<p>The move served as a warning to Republicans in other states who are trying to restrict voting, a move that both Republicans and Democrats in the state oppose despite fiercely disagreeing about the new voting law. The action is likely to put additional pressure on other organizations and corporations to consider pulling business out of Georgia.</p>
		<p>The announcement by the baseball commissioner, Rob Manfred, came after days of lobbying from civil rights groups and discussions with stakeholders like the Major League Baseball Players Association.</p>

                </div>
		<p>Rep. Matt Gaetz (R., Fla.) on Friday said he wouldn’t resign in the face of rising pressure over reports that the FBI has been investigating him since last summer, in part over whether he broke federal sex-trafficking laws.</p>
		<p>With the House in recess, members have been largely silent about Mr. Gaetz since Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) earlier in the week referred to “serious implications” in connection with the Federal Bureau of Investigation inquiry. But in the state capital of Tallahassee, Republicans were already discussing who would replace Mr. Gaetz, people familiar with the conversations said.</p>
