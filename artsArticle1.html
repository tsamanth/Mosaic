        <p>
            <br/><br/>Amy Winehouse's mother is seizing the chance to reclaim her daughter's story, taking part in a BBC documentary to mark the 10th anniversary of the troubled singer's death.
            <br/> <br/>In a documentary for BBC Two entitled "Amy Winehouse: 10 Years On," Janis Winehouse will make a rare public appearance to offer her perspective on her daughter's highly publicized life and legacy.
            <br/><br/>Winehouse was found dead at her north London home on July 23, 2011, at age 27. She had struggled with alcohol and drug misuse for several years.
            <br/><br/>"I don't feel the world knew the true Amy, the one I brought up," Janis Winehouse said in a press release about the documentary.
