        <p>
            <br/><br/>A painting of Paris by Vincent van Gogh, barely seen by the public after being stashed in a French family's private collection for more than a century, sold at auction Thursday for 13.1 million euros ($15.4 million).
            <br/> <br/>"Street scene in Montmartre" was painted in the spring of 1887, three years before the Dutch master is believed to have died by suicide. It fetched significantly more than the top estimate of 8 million euros ($9.4 million) during a sale at Sotheby's in Paris.
            <br/><br/>But the auction, which also saw works by the likes of Edgar Degas and René Magritte go under the hammer, generated an amount of confusion, with Sotheby's initially declaring that the Van Gogh had sold for over 16 million euros ($19.1 million). Following what a Sotheby's spokesperson called a "bidding error," the painting was then offered to buyers again at the end of the sale, with a second round of bidding resulting in the lower final price.
            <br/><br/>Van Gogh's painting shows Parisians walking through a rural and sparse landscape in Montmartre, a historic district that today is one of the city's most popular destinations.
