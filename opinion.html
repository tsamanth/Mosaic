		<h3><a href = "opinionArticle1.html">The SEIU as ‘Infrastructure’</a></h3>
		<p>When is a $2.3 trillion infrastructure bill not really about infrastructure? How about when $400 billion would go to expand Medicaid payments for home healthcare, with much of that padding the rolls of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU)? That not-so-little detail is one of the line items the media don’t want to cover in President Biden’s latest spending blowout. Allow us to fill the information gap.</p>
                <h3><a href = "opinionArticle2.html">Inconvenient Facts for the War on Testing</a></h3>
		<p>Among the “emergency” progressive policy changes likely to persist after the Covid-19 pandemic is the abandonment of standardized testing in college admissions. Anti-testing activists had been winning the argument for years by claiming the tests favor privileged students. After social distancing disrupted test taking in 2020, the future scope of the SAT and ACT is uncertain.</p>
                <h3><a href = "opinionArticle3.html">Covid Arsenal Needs Pills as Well as Shots</a></h3>
		<p>More than 60 million Americans are fully vaccinated for Covid-19, and the number rises daily. But some people aren’t willing or easily able to get vaccinated, and others won’t be able to get the shot for medical reasons, such as immune suppression. Another good weapon for the Covid arsenal would be a safe and effective drug that could be taken at home. Such outpatient drugs exist to prevent and treat the flu, and one public-health focus should be developing a Covid pill that could be taken after exposure, or soon after symptoms appear, to stop the infection from progressing.</p>

                <h3><a href = "opinionOped1.html">This Peeler Did Not Need to Be Wrapped in So Much Plastic</a></h3>
		<p>The year 2020 may have been heartbreaking for most humans, but it was a good one for Jeff Bezos and Amazon. His company’s worldwide sales grew 38 percent from 2019, and Amazon sold more than 1.5 billion products during the 2020 holiday season alone. Did you need a book, disposable surgical mask, beauty product, or garden hose? Amazon was probably your online marketplace. If you wanted to purchase a Nicolas Cage pillowcase or a harness with leash for your chicken, Amazon had your back (They’re #17 and #39 on a 2019 Good Housekeeping list of the 40 ‘weirdest” products available on the website “that people actually love.”) From pandemic misery came consumer comfort and corporate profit.</p>
                <h3><a href = "opinionOped2.html">School: It’s Not Just for Kids Anymore</a></h3>
		<p>Both children and parents do better when they have access to nutrition, health care and economic opportunity. Why not provide them all in one place? In March of last year, the week before the pandemic shuttered schools in Washington, D.C., Annie Macheel’s Advanced Adult English as a Second Language class at Briya Public Charter School in Fort Totten was making plans. At one table, four women — two native Spanish-speakers, one Amharic speaker, and one Vietnamese speaker — haltingly practiced scheduling play dates for their children in English. Outside, in the hall, a group of pre-kindergartners — some of whom had mothers at that table — cheerfully burbled past the door, “caminando, caminando, volando, volando” (walking, walking, flying, flying).</p>
                <h3><a href = "opinionOped3.html">The Death of the Last Juma Elder in the Amazon</a></h3>
		<p>On Feb. 17, Aruká Juma, the last surviving man of the Juma people in the Brazilian Amazon, died of Covid-19 in a hospital in Pôrto Velho, the capital of Rondônia State, in northern Brazil. Mr. Juma, who was born in the 1930s in a jungle village on the Açuã River roughly 450 miles from the Amazonas State capital, Manaus, represented his community and their world. He was like the giant trees of the Amazon, and he fell.</p>

		<h3><a href = "opinionArticle4.html">How to stop a killing like that of George Floyd from ever happening again</a></h3>

		<img src = "trial.jpg" alt = "chauvin trial" width = "250" height = "150"></br >
		</div>
                <p>First there was the agonizing video, showing Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin grinding his knee into George Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes as three of his colleagues watched and didn't intervene. Then came the protests, a national wave of outrage coursing through communities large and small. 
				<br></br>Now the nation is watching Chauvin's trial, underway in a Minnesota courtroom -- nearly 10 months after Floyd's death. It's a chance for the wheels of justice to finally turn. And it's a moment to ask ourselves: If another officer were to engage in similar misconduct today, would his colleagues again refuse to step in and stop it?</p>
		<h3><a href = "opinionArticle5.html">Jill Biden's first ladyship is a long way from cookie bake-offs and state dinners</a></h3>

		</div>
                <p>Dr. Jill Biden is back in the classroom this month, carrying a course load of three classes as she returns to her full-time teaching job at Northern Virginia Community College. Her work looks a bit different after a year off on the campaign trail. Two of the classes are hybrid, featuring live-streamed instruction as part of the Covid protocols not yet necessary when she took a leave of absence last January. 
				<br></br>She also returns with a new title: First lady of the United States. In retaining her full-time job, Biden is breaking tradition — and a glass ceiling that has hovered over first ladies throughout US history. It is the second time she has made this particularly kind of history: when her husband was vice president, she became the first second lady of the United States to hold a full-time job. As second lady, she not only spent her time grading papers and teaching classes, but leveraging her political role to fight for things like free community college. That dedication no doubt comes in part from her career as a teacher at a community college, a job that she sees as both a calling and a form of service.</p>

		</div>
		<p>A year into this global pandemic, we have seen anything but an effective, coordinated approach among nations to address the crisis on a global scale. Amid this backdrop, Tuesday's news that a group of countries is pledging to work together to prevent future pandemics can be regarded only as a positive development for the world. 
		<br></br>The so-called pandemic treaty to bring greater international cooperation for public health emergencies has been endorsed by more than 20 world leaders -- but not by the US, China, India and Russia -- in an editorial published in several media outlets and on the World Health Organization (WHO) website on Tuesday. The world leaders wrote that they are "committed to ensuring universal and equitable access to safe, efficacious and affordable vaccines, medicines and diagnostics for this and future pandemics."</p>
