        <p>
            <br/><br/>A year into this global pandemic, we have seen anything but an effective, coordinated approach among nations to address the crisis on a global scale. Amid this backdrop, Tuesday's news that a group of countries is pledging to work together to prevent future pandemics can be regarded only as a positive development for the world.
            <br/><br/>The so-called pandemic treaty to bring greater international cooperation for public health emergencies has been endorsed by more than 20 world leaders -- but not by the US, China, India and Russia -- in an editorial published in several media outlets and on the World Health Organization (WHO) website on Tuesday. The world leaders wrote that they are "committed to ensuring universal and equitable access to safe, efficacious and affordable vaccines, medicines and diagnostics for this and future pandemics."
            <br/><br/>"We believe that nations should work together towards a new international treaty for pandemic preparedness and response," they added.
            <br/><br/>Though China and the US did not participate in the editorial, WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus noted that both countries had a positive reaction to the treaty.
