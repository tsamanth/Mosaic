            Scientists analyze the world’s complexity to identify its underlying universal laws. Mystics immerse themselves in life’s complexity to experience a spiritual unity. And Arab artists from the eighth to 10th centuries combined both impulses as they began designing ever more elaborate geometric patterns. Richard Henry, a respected teacher in the field, describes the resulting art form as “the beauty of heavens brought down to earth.”
            <br/> <br/>Whether a carpet with motifs that seem to flow beyond the fabric’s edges or walls teeming with interlocking patterns whose figure-ground relationships are at times ambiguous, Islamic geometrics both excite the eye and calm the spirit. As explosive as some designs feel; as random as some shapes appear; and as overwhelming as the juxtaposition of ornamentations can be, undergirding each—like an unseen safety net—is a mathematical structure.
            <br/><br/>We can only begin to discern this underlying order if we first understand how the repeating motifs are made. Art historian D. Fairchild Ruggles offers a good introduction in the “Islamic Art Spots: Geometry” video, part of the Bridging Cultures-Muslim Journeys series by the Ali Vural Ak Center for Global Islamic Studies at George Mason University. Geometry played such a central role in ancient Muslim societies, from calculating distances to determining the direction of Mecca for prayers, that people recognized the numerical logic of patterns. She illustrates this by superimposing onto a building’s decorations a matrix of polygons, showing how the voids create the motif’s central stars. The effect can be so dizzying, she adds, “the eye no longer perceives the initial form but, instead, becomes immersed in the overall design.”
