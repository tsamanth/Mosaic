		<p>Amy Winehouse's mother is seizing the chance to reclaim her daughter's story, taking part in a BBC documentary to mark the 10th anniversary of the troubled singer's death.
        <br/><br/>In a documentary for BBC Two entitled "Amy Winehouse: 10 Years On," Janis Winehouse will make a rare public appearance to offer her perspective on her daughter's highly publicized life and legacy.</p>
        <h3><a href = "artsArticle2.html">Unseen Vincent van Gogh painting of Paris sells for $15.4M</a></h3>
		<p>A painting of Paris by Vincent van Gogh, barely seen by the public after being stashed in a French family's private collection for more than a century, sold at auction Thursday for 13.1 million euros ($15.4 million).
        <br/><br/>"Street scene in Montmartre" was painted in the spring of 1887, three years before the Dutch master is believed to have died by suicide. It fetched significantly more than the top estimate of 8 million euros ($9.4 million) during a sale at Sotheby's in Paris.</p>
        <h3><a href = "artsArticle3.html">Small silver snail artifact may be a medieval 'meme'</a></h3>
		<p>TThey may not have had the internet, but medieval people still liked to share a joke -- as the discovery of what archaeologists are dubbing a historic "meme" found in northern England suggests.
        <br/><br/>A "quirky and unique" mount depicting a man emerging from a snail's shell on the back of a goat was discovered in a field in Pontefract, West Yorkshire, last year.
        <br/><br/>The piece dates from 1200-1350 A.D. and experts at the British Museum believe the unusual artifact may have been a form of "medieval meme."</p>

        <h3><a href = "artsOped1.html">Opinion/Op-ed: Like an Open Book</a></h3>
		<p>In architecture, as in drama, it is unwise to upstage the star. Additions to a building, if it has any historical or aesthetic significance, should defer to the original. At Smith College’s renovated Neilson Library, which opened on March 29, this rule is gleefully turned on its head.</p>
        <h3><a href = "artsOped2.html">Opinion/Op-ed: ‘Picasso. Figures’ Review: Magic, Malleable Human Forms</a></h3>
		<p>If you visit “Picasso. Figures,” at the Frist Art Museum (its only U.S. venue), I recommend that you walk straight to gallery three. There loops a two-minute excerpt from Paul Haesaerts’s 1949 black-and-white documentary “Visit to Picasso.” Filmed at the artist’s studio in Vallauris, France, it shows Pablo Picasso (1881-1973) painting in white line on large glass plates, as Haesaerts films from the other side—offering us a real-time window into the Spanish master’s nimble, creative practice. In one shot, Picasso paints a bull’s head, which then becomes a woman’s bust. In another, he paints a tall, delicate stem, perched on as if by a bird; or perhaps capped by a flame or flower.</p>
        <h3><a href = "artsOped3.html">Opinion/Op-ed: The Staying Inside Guide: The Math Behind Mesmerizing Islamic Patterns</a></h3>
		<p>Scientists analyze the world’s complexity to identify its underlying universal laws. Mystics immerse themselves in life’s complexity to experience a spiritual unity. And Arab artists from the eighth to 10th centuries combined both impulses as they began designing ever more elaborate geometric patterns. Richard Henry, a respected teacher in the field, describes the resulting art form as “the beauty of heavens brought down to earth.”</p>

                <br/><br/>"Game Changer," which the enigmatic street artist donated to the University Hospital Southampton (UHS) in May of 2020 during the first wave of the pandemic, depicts a young child playing with a toy nurse wearing a Red Cross emblem, a cape and face mask. In a nearby basket, figurines of Batman and Spiderman lay forgotten.</p>

            <p>Like many girls who grew up in the '90s, journalist Masuma Ahuja often found her own experiences reflected in Ann M. Martin's series "The Babysitters' Club." Her favorite character was the effortlessly polished Stacey McGill, but not necessarily for her style or New York City roots: Stacey, like Ahuja, is a Type I diabetic, and, as a child, Ahuja didn't know anyone else her age who dealt with the day-to-day complexity of the disease.
            <br/><br/>"Those books were really important to me, because it was a way for me to feel seen, and to understand that I wasn't alone, even if it was a fictional character," said Ahuja in a video interview..</p>
