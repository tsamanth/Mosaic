        <p>
            <br/><br/>They may not have had the internet, but medieval people still liked to share a joke -- as the discovery of what archaeologists are dubbing a historic "meme" found in northern England suggests.
            <br/> <br/>A "quirky and unique" mount depicting a man emerging from a snail's shell on the back of a goat was discovered in a field in Pontefract, West Yorkshire, last year.
            <br/><br/>The piece dates from 1200-1350 A.D. and experts at the British Museum believe the unusual artifact may have been a form of "medieval meme."
            <br/><br/>Memes have become an every day part of 21st century life, as people around the world share amusing or entertaining images, videos or other items online -- especially via social media.
