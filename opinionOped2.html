        <p>
            <br/><br/>In March of last year, the week before the pandemic shuttered schools in Washington, D.C., Annie Macheel’s Advanced Adult English as a Second Language class at Briya Public Charter School in Fort Totten was making plans. At one table, four women — two native Spanish-speakers, one Amharic speaker, and one Vietnamese speaker — haltingly practiced scheduling play dates for their children in English. Outside, in the hall, a group of pre-kindergartners — some of whom had mothers at that table — cheerfully burbled past the door, “caminando, caminando, volando, volando” (walking, walking, flying, flying).
            <br/><br/>This juxtaposition — family members decades apart, but attending classes down the hall from one another — is central to a “dual-generation” educational approach.
            <br/><br/>Briya has four dual-generation locations in Washington, and other such models abound across the country: The Aspen Institute’s Ascend Network includes more than 400 organizational partners implementing dual-generation approaches.
            <br/><br/>These programs have a straightforward theory of education: If children’s success is tightly intertwined with their families’ stability (and we know it is), and families do better when they have access to nutrition, health care and economic opportunity, why not address all of these needs together?
