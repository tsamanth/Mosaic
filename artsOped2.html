        <p>
            <br/><br/>
            If you visit “Picasso. Figures,” at the Frist Art Museum (its only U.S. venue), I recommend that you walk straight to gallery three. There loops a two-minute excerpt from Paul Haesaerts’s 1949 black-and-white documentary “Visit to Picasso.” Filmed at the artist’s studio in Vallauris, France, it shows Pablo Picasso (1881-1973) painting in white line on large glass plates, as Haesaerts films from the other side—offering us a real-time window into the Spanish master’s nimble, creative practice. In one shot, Picasso paints a bull’s head, which then becomes a woman’s bust. In another, he paints a tall, delicate stem, perched on as if by a bird; or perhaps capped by a flame or flower. After the artist makes a few adjacent strokes that suggest trees, and then human limbs, Picasso’s stem transforms into the vertical juncture between the standing legs of a life-size female nude. And now the bird/flame/flower also reads as the crowning “V” of her sex—culminating in a long-haired figure reminiscent of Sandro Botticelli’s windswept protagonist in “The Birth of Venus” (c. 1485).
            <br/> <br/>It’s not that you have to start with Haesaerts’s film in this exhilarating, chronological exhibition of approximately 75 paintings, drawings, prints and sculptures. To do so, however, will ground you in Picasso’s magical, malleable approach to his subject. Picasso was a traditional genre artist. And this show would be equally compelling if its focus were still lifes or landscapes or interiors. Haesaerts’s film establishes that, as Picasso explores the figure, his forms are forever in flux, always associative and metaphorical, never descriptive, never fixed. Picasso is not so much depicting figures as he is meditating on the theme of metamorphosis. He explores the complex relationships between artist and model; among family members, lovers and friends; between himself and other artists.
            <br/><br/>Co-curated by Emilia Philippot and François Dareau from the Musée National Picasso-Paris—and drawn entirely from that museum’s permanent collection of over 5,000 Picassos—every work in “Picasso. Figures” is exceptional. If for no other reason than that the majority of these artworks are from the artist’s private collection—Picasso’s Picassos. Often, his attachment is understandable. The show opens with “The Barefoot Girl” (1895)—the kind of painting that causes bottlenecks. An astonishing, full-length, melancholic portrait of a girl in a long red dress, it rivals figures by Bartolomé Esteban Murillo and Gustave Courbet. Picasso painted it when he was 13.
