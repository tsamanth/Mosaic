        <p>
            <br/><br/>On Feb. 17, Aruká Juma, the last surviving man of the Juma people in the Brazilian Amazon, died of Covid-19 in a hospital in Pôrto Velho, the capital of Rondônia State, in northern Brazil. Mr. Juma, who was born in the 1930s in a jungle village on the Açuã River roughly 450 miles from the Amazonas State capital, Manaus, represented his community and their world. He was like the giant trees of the Amazon, and he fell.
            <br/><br/>The story of Mr. Juma is also the story of the world’s largest rainforest. His ancestors and those of other Indigenous groups planted many of the Amazon’s trees before the arrival of European colonists in 1500. As the colonizers harvested their forests for global trade, their people were decimated. Like the Juma people, the Amazon is at risk of extinction.
            <br/><br/>The overwhelming majority of the Amazon’s Indigenous peoples were wiped out from the 16th to 19th centuries by disease and massacres at the hands of colonizers. In the first half of the 20th century, with the expansion of the rubber trade, mining and agribusiness, dozens of Indigenous groups became extinct.
            <br/><br/>The Juma’s population was reduced from an estimated 12,000 to 15,000 in the 18th century to about 100 in 1943. In the early 1960s, many of the Juma were systematically executed by land invaders. Some killers made a game of tossing children into the air and impaling them with machetes before they hit the ground. A massacre in 1964 left just seven survivors. None of those responsible have been held accountable for their crimes.
