            <br/><br/>Like many girls who grew up in the '90s, journalist Masuma Ahuja often found her own experiences reflected in Ann M. Martin's series "The Babysitters' Club." Her favorite character was the effortlessly polished Stacey McGill, but not necessarily for her style or New York City roots: Stacey, like Ahuja, is a Type I diabetic, and, as a child, Ahuja didn't know anyone else her age who dealt with the day-to-day complexity of the disease.
            <br/> <br/>"Those books were really important to me, because it was a way for me to feel seen, and to understand that I wasn't alone, even if it was a fictional character," said Ahuja in a video interview.
            <br/><br/>As an adult, Ahuja has reported on the lives of girls and women through a political and social lens for the Washington Post and CNN. But her first book, "Girlhood: Teens Around the World in Their Own Voices" chronicles the everyday lives of 30 girls, ages 13 to 19, from their own perspectives. Together, they come from 27 different countries.
            <br/><br/>If, like Ahuja, you find resonance in the details of others' lives, the diaristic entries offer an anthology of experiences that you can keep returning to. Through "Girlhood," Ahuja sets out to answer the question, "How would the story of girlhood be told if girls were the ones to write it?"
